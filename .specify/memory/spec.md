# Feature Specification: LandComp AI App Core Features

**Feature Branch**: `main`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI-powered landscape design and gardening assistant app"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - AI-Powered Plant Recommendations (Priority: P1)

As a gardening enthusiast, I want to get personalized plant recommendations based on my location, soil type, and preferences, so that I can create a thriving garden without extensive research.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the app - providing AI-driven plant recommendations that save users time and increase gardening success rates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by inputting location data, soil conditions, and preferences, then verifying that the AI returns relevant plant suggestions with care instructions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the app for the first time, **When** they input their location and soil type, **Then** the app should display a curated list of suitable plants
2. **Given** a user has specified their gardening experience level, **When** they request plant recommendations, **Then** the app should prioritize plants appropriate for their skill level
3. **Given** a user has selected specific plant preferences (sun/shade, water needs), **When** they search for plants, **Then** the app should filter results based on these criteria

### User Story 2 - Garden Design Planning (Priority: P1)

As a landscape designer, I want to create visual garden layouts and get AI suggestions for plant placement, so that I can design beautiful, functional outdoor spaces efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Visual planning is essential for landscape design and differentiates the app from simple plant databases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a garden layout, adding plants to specific areas, and verifying that the AI provides placement suggestions and compatibility warnings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has created a garden layout, **When** they drag a plant to a specific location, **Then** the app should validate compatibility with existing plants and environmental conditions
2. **Given** a user has defined garden dimensions, **When** they request design suggestions, **Then** the app should provide layout recommendations with proper spacing
3. **Given** a user has selected plants for their garden, **When** they view the design, **Then** the app should show seasonal changes and growth projections

### User Story 3 - Plant Care Management (Priority: P2)

As a plant owner, I want to track my plants' care schedules and receive reminders, so that I can maintain healthy plants without forgetting important tasks.

**Why this priority**: Care management increases user engagement and helps users succeed with their plants, leading to better app retention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding plants to a care list, setting up care schedules, and verifying that reminders are generated correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has added plants to their garden, **When** they set up care schedules, **Then** the app should generate appropriate watering, fertilizing, and pruning reminders
2. **Given** a user has received a care reminder, **When** they mark the task as completed, **Then** the app should update the next scheduled reminder
3. **Given** a user has plants with different care needs, **When** they view their care dashboard, **Then** the app should prioritize urgent tasks and group similar activities

---

### User Story 4 - Plant Identification (Priority: P2)

As a curious gardener, I want to identify unknown plants by taking photos, so that I can learn about plants I encounter and get care information.

**Why this priority**: Plant identification is a common user need and adds significant value to the app's utility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by taking photos of various plants and verifying that the AI correctly identifies them with confidence scores and care information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user takes a clear photo of a plant, **When** they submit it for identification, **Then** the app should return the most likely species with care instructions
2. **Given** a user takes a blurry or unclear photo, **When** they submit it for identification, **Then** the app should request a better photo or provide multiple possible matches
3. **Given** a user has identified a plant, **When** they view the results, **Then** the app should offer to add it to their garden or care list

---

### User Story 5 - Community Features (Priority: P3)

As a gardening community member, I want to share my garden progress and get advice from other users, so that I can learn from experienced gardeners and showcase my work.

**Why this priority**: Community features increase user engagement and provide additional value through peer learning, but are not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating posts, sharing garden photos, and verifying that community interactions work properly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has created a garden design, **When** they choose to share it publicly, **Then** other users should be able to view and comment on their design
2. **Given** a user has a question about plant care, **When** they post it to the community, **Then** other users should be able to provide answers and advice
3. **Given** a user wants to follow other gardeners, **When** they search for users, **Then** the app should allow them to follow and see updates from those users

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI service is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle users in regions with limited plant database coverage?
- What happens when users input invalid location data or soil conditions?
- How does the system handle offline scenarios when users need to access their garden data?
- What happens when users have conflicting plant preferences or environmental constraints?
